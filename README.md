# Text-Indexer
The objective was like in adobe pdf reader there is one option called find word that will find the word &amp; also show that word how many times that word will present in that file. Same here we created the data base in such a way that we can easily store the data, search data, update database &amp; backup database. in particular folder text file containing some name so we fetch the name one by one and create hash table  which is link with link list and each link list store name and each node have file table and file table contain the file name and how many times that word present in that file.
